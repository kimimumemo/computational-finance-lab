# Computational Finance Lab

This repository is a collection of my projects in financial mathematics and computational finance. I worked on these during my undergraduate studies in applied mathematics, and the goal was to take core mathematical concepts and apply them to real-world financial problems using Python.

I've grouped the notebooks into topics like option pricing, simulations, portfolio optimization, and risk modeling. The code is all written in Jupyter notebooks and designed to be easy to follow and experiment with.
